# TF_QuantSimul
This repo contains unofficial implementations of DL model quantization methods.

- QuantSimul.py is implementation of Quantization and Training of Neural Networks for Efficient Integer-Arithmetic-Only Inference (Jacob et al, 2017)

- MBQuant.py is implementation of Distribution-Aware Adaptive Multi-Bit Quantization (Zhao et al, 2021)

Codes might be 'messy' due to the fact that the codes were original not meant to be publicly accessible.
